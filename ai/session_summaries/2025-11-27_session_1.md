## Summary
- Enabled inline video playback in the web UI by turning on the Play button for generated files.
- Added `-movflags +faststart` to FFmpeg concatenation to optimize progressive playback for the player.
- Added a visible player container on the main (left) column so HTMX Play actions have a clear render target.
- Added HLS generation for each output (playlist + segments) and updated the player to use `hls.js` with MP4 fallback.
- Implemented retention limits that delete older MP4s and their HLS artifacts, honoring per-player/game and total caps.
- Added a quick-open button beside the Google Sheet URL to open the sheet in a new tab.
- Added optional games.yaml metadata enrichment (stream URL, title) per tournament, exposed to the frontend with a games table (watch links + select) and a title defaulting to the filename stem.
- Allowed metadata files named `games.yml` as well and surface a UI notice when no teams are found.
- Fixed the games table "Use" button quoting to avoid JS syntax errors when rendering paths.
- Simplified game selection to click-to-select in the table (removed the game dropdown, added row highlighting, and icon-only watch link).
- Restyled headers with blue bars and moved Generated Files inline below the generate button for full-width readability; removed the old "How to use" card in favor of inline popover help.
- Simplified Generated Files labels to `<directory name> | <filename without timestamp>` to avoid brittle parsing of names.
