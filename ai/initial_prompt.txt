I am looking to create an command line application that uses ffmpeg to slice up video from sports games and create highlights for different players.  My goal is to take a single video and create highlight videos for individual players.

I want the inputs to be:
- a movie that we want to cut up.
- a csv file that contains timestamps (in/out) and player names.

I want to create a video for each player that has the selected clips.

I want this code infrastructure:
- use ffmpg 
- be written in python (3.13)
- use uv for environment management
- use pytest for testing
- have good documentation on how to use the tool in a separete docs directory.
- command line interface should use click
- logging should use the standard python logging library and not print
- processing of csv and debug prints should leverage pandas

Special command line options:
- a knob to add extra time to the in/out of the timestamps
- dry run that just shows what will be generated for each player including the number of clips and total time (use pandas)

As part of this project, I would like to keep track of how I interact with the AI.  please create a directory to manage this information.  This should help the AI with context and the user with background on the AI usage.  As part of this, please save this prompt as a txt file.

before start to generate code, please ask any clarifying questions and help me understand the genereal plan.
