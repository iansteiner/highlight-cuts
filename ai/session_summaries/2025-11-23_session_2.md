# AI Session Summary - Session 2

**Date**: 2025-11-23
**Project**: Highlight Cuts

## Overview
Second session focused on adding user control over output file locations.

## Feature: Output Directory Option

### What
Added `--output-dir` CLI argument to allow users to specify where generated highlight videos should be saved.

### Why
Users needed control over where output files are created instead of always saving to the current directory.

### How
-   Modified `cli.py` to add the new `--output-dir` option with a default value of `.` (current directory).
-   Added logic to create the output directory if it doesn't exist using `Path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.
-   Updated the output file path construction to use `os.path.join(output_dir, output_filename)`.

### Testing
Added three new tests in `test_cli.py`:
-   `test_cli_output_dir`: Verifies files are created in the specified directory.
-   `test_cli_output_dir_created`: Verifies the directory is created if it doesn't exist.
-   `test_cli_default_output_dir`: Verifies backward compatibility with default behavior.

### Documentation
-   Updated `docs/usage.md` with the new option and added an example.
-   Updated `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with the feature.

## Outcome
-   All 27 tests pass with 96% code coverage.
-   Feature is fully functional and documented.
-   Users can now organize output files in custom directories.
