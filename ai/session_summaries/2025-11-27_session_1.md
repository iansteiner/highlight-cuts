## Summary
- Enabled inline video playback in the web UI by turning on the Play button for generated files.
- Added `-movflags +faststart` to FFmpeg concatenation to optimize progressive playback for the player.
- Added a visible player container on the main (left) column so HTMX Play actions have a clear render target.
- Added HLS generation for each output (playlist + segments) and updated the player to use `hls.js` with MP4 fallback.
- Implemented retention limits that delete older MP4s and their HLS artifacts, honoring per-player/game and total caps.
- Added a quick-open button beside the Google Sheet URL to open the sheet in a new tab.

## Testing
- `uv run pytest tests/test_ffmpeg.py tests/test_web_comprehensive.py::TestVideoPlayerEndpoint tests/test_web_comprehensive.py::TestRetentionLimits`

## Notes
- Lint/format: `uv run ruff check --fix .` and `uv run ruff format .`.
